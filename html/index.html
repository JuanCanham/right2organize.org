<h3>Corporate Landlords Submit Ballot Measure to Create Confusion for November 2024 Ballot</h3>
<p>While Berkeley continues to face an extreme housing affordability crisis, two corporate landlords (Milestone Properties and Flynn Clement Properties) are trying to prevent Berkeley from protecting tenants. On March 21st, a notice was circulated for a ballot measure that would substantially weaken the ability of the Berkeley Rent Board to protect tenants in Berkeley. This comes in response to our coalition of unions, tenants, and community organizations coming together to collect signatures to strengthen Berkeley’s rent control ordinance with the Berkeley Tenant Protection and Right to Organize Act.</p>
                <p>Confusion has been the most effective tool of corporate landlords in preventing protections for tenants from being passed in other cities. Let’s be clear - this measure is an attempt by corporate landlords to confuse Berkeley voters. Their measure would:
                <ul>
                    <li>Prohibit the Rent Board from protecting tenants facing uninhabitable and unsafe conditions</li>
                    <li>Increase the amount rent can go up every year in rent controlled units</li>
                    <li>Prevents the Rent Board from suing landlords who violate the law</li>
                    <li>Strip tenants who currently have tenant rights from being protected by the Rent Board</li>
                    <li>Prevents reductions in rent when construction work seriously disrupts the ability of tenants to live in a unit, thereby incentivizing landlords to harass rent-controlled tenants into leaving through “renovictions”</li>
                    <li>Allows tenants to be evicted for violating any city ordinance, even if unrelated to their housing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In contrast, the Berkeley Tenant Protection and Right to Organize Act - which was publicly developed by the Berkeley Rent Board at numerous public meetings - will expand tenant protections and give tenants a robust and enforceable right to organize tenant associations.</p>

                            I am confident that Berkeley voters will see through the corporate landlords’ strategy of chaos. Time and again, corporate money flows into Berkeley elections, only to be defeated by community organizing and the grassroots. The misinformation of these corporate landlords highlights the critical role of rent boards and tenant protections in keeping tenants in their homes.

                            We are disappointed but not surprised that rather than making their case to the voters on their opposition to tenant protections, the landlords and wealthy special interests are presenting their assault on tenants’ rights as a good thing for tenants in order to confuse the public. Only one measure, the Berkeley Tenant Protection and Right to Organize Act, will bring our rent control ordinance up to 21st century standards and keep tenants in their homes. By contrast, this corporate measure will weaken the Rent Board’s ability to protect tenants and strip tenants of protections they currently have.”

                            Working people and tenants are able to improve our working and living conditions when we come together and fight. Our union organized the largest academic worker strike in US history last year in response to the extremely high cost of living in cities like Berkeley compared to the wages UC was paying us. Just like we won together last year as workers, now us tenants are coming together to win the ability to bargain for lower rent and better living conditions. The landlords, like the bosses, are scared and trying to undermine our efforts, but we won’t let them stop tenants like us from organizing for a better future.
